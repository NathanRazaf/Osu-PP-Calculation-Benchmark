# Osu-PP-Calculation-Benchmark

A personal project in which I want to test the public and open source Osu PP calculators that I could find online, like [rosu-pp-js](https://github.com/MaxOhn/rosu-pp-js), [ojsama](https://github.com/Francesco149/ojsama), [osu-tools/PerformanceCalculator](https://github.com/ppy/osu-tools/tree/master/PerformanceCalculator). All rights are reserved to (sorry in advance if I omitted some people, I'm very not good at that) Osu!, its developers, and these GitHub repositories' authors, owners and contributors. The benchmark's accuracy will depend on how often I'll execute `npm update` on my project before redeploying the app.

Still in conception phase
